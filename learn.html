        <h3>1. Reduce Your Use of Single-Use Plastics </h3>
        <p>An easy and direct way you can get started is by reducing your own use of single-use plastics, including plastic bags, water bottles, straws, cups, utensils, dry cleaning bags, take-out containers, and any other plastic items that are used once and then discarded.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>refusing any single-use plastics that you do not need (e.g. straws, plastic bags, takeout utensils, takeout containers)</li>
            <li>purchasing, and carrying with you, reusable versions of those products, including reusable grocery bags, produce bags, bottles, utensils, coffee cups, and dry cleaning garment bags.</li>
            <li>when you refuse single-use plastic items, help businesses by letting them know that you would like them to offer alternatives.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>2. Recycle Properly</h3>
        <p>This should go without saying, but when you use single-use (and other) plastics that can be recycled, always be sure to recycle them. At present, just 9% of plastic is recycled worldwide. Recycling helps keep plastics out of the ocean and reduces the amount of “new” plastic in circulation. If you need help finding a place to recycle plastic waste near you, check Earth911’s recycling directory. It's also important to check with your local recycling center about the types of plastic they accept.</p>

        <h3>3. Avoid Products Containing Microbeads</h3>
        <p>Tiny plastic particles, called “microbeads,” have become a growing source of ocean plastic pollution in recent years. Microbeads are found in some face scrubs, toothpastes, and bodywashes, and they readily enter our oceans and waterways through our sewer systems, and affect hundreds of marine species. Avoid products containing plastic microbeads by looking for “polythelene” and “polypropylene” on the ingredient labels of your cosmetic products.</p>

        <h3>5. Support Organizations Addressing Plastic Pollution</h3>
        <p>There are many non-profit organizations working to reduce and eliminate ocean plastic pollution in a variety of different ways, including Oceanic Society, Plastic Pollution Coalition, 5 Gyres, Algalita, Plastic Soup Foundation, and others. These organizations rely on donations from people like you to continue their important work. Even small donations can make a big difference!</p>
